```

### **Geographic Bounds**
UK waters coverage (can be modified in `ais_stream_client.py`):
```python
self.bounds = {
    'north': 60.0,   # Northern Scotland
    'south': 50.0,   # Southern England  
    'east': 2.0,     # Eastern England
    'west': -10.0    # Western Ireland
}
```

### **Update Intervals**
- **Ship data**: 10 seconds (slower than aircraft due to ship movement patterns)
- **Connection monitoring**: Continuous
- **UI updates**: Real-time with data reception

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **No Ships Appearing**
1. Check AIS connection status in Ships tab
2. Verify internet connectivity for WebSocket
3. Ensure radar range includes shipping lanes
4. Check ship filters aren't too restrictive

### **Connection Issues**
1. Click **üîå Disconnect** then **üîó Connect AIS**
2. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
3. Verify API key is valid and has remaining quota
4. Check firewall settings for WebSocket connections

### **Performance Issues**
1. Reduce radar range to decrease ship count
2. Use ship filters to limit displayed vessels
3. Switch to "Aircraft Only" mode if needed
4. Check browser performance with large datasets
